# Contribution guidelines

## Welcome!
We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to an Ontario Digital Service (ODS) project! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. Our staff follow the ODS Code of Conduct and all contributors should do the same.

We encourage you to read this project's contributing policy (you are here), its [license](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

You can share your thoughts and ideas by:

* emailing us 
* forking our GitHub repository

### By email

* Send us plain text formats like text files, Word documents and Google docs by email
* Do not send HTML, PDF, printed paper or handwritten notes
* Tell us what section your suggestions apply to
* If you’re sending email or plain text: include the original text for reference and your proposed changes
* If you’re sending a Word or Google document: use track changes or suggest mode
* Tell us the reason for your suggestion and the benefit it will have

### On GitHub

NOTE: The `develop` branch is a working draft. The official version is in the master branch.

* Use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started) to format your changes
* Don't use HTML unless the changes you want to make are not supported in markdown (for example, headings inside a table)
* Fork off of our `develop` branch, and make a pull request back to develop when you’re ready to merge.
* Name your branch with your first name or user name, the type of change (“fix” for small cosmetic edits,  “feature” for any additions or deletions), followed by a description of your changes. For example: `name/fix/correcting-typos` OR `name/feature/updates-to-standard`
* Make one commit per change and explain the reasoning for your change in your commit message (not what you changed, but why)
