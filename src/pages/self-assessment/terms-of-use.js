          <h2 id="about">About the self-assessment</h2>
          <p>
            The online COVID-19 self-assessment tool allows you to enter certain identifying and personal health
            information related to your potential COVID-19 symptoms. It is not intended to provide medical
            advice. Consult a health practitioner or your local public health unit if you have medical questions.
          </p>

          <h2 id="how-we-use">How we use your information</h2>
          <p>
            Your information is provided to the Ministry of Health. The ministry maintains the tool and all information
            that is put into the tool. Ontario Health, a provincial agency, acts on behalf of the ministry to facilitate
            the management of your information.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ministry will only use or disclose the information you provide in the tool to investigate, eliminate or
            reduce the current COVID-19 outbreak risk. It will not be used for any other purposes.
          </p>

          <h3>Contacting you</h3>
          <p>
            Someone from the ministry and/or the local public health unit may contact you if you choose to provide your
            contact details in the tool. The purpose of contacting you is to provide information to you regarding your
            COVID-19 personal response, and to collect additional information from you for the purpose of investigating,
            eliminating or reducing the current COVID-19 outbreak.
          </p>

          <h3>Authorized use</h3>
          <p>
            The collection, use and disclosure of your information, with your permission, is authorized or permitted
            under the Health Protection and Promotion Act and the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004.
          </p>

          <h3>Your agreement</h3>
          <p>
            By inputting your personal information and personal health information into the tool, you are agreeing to
            the ministry’s collection, use, and disclosure of this information for the purpose of investigating,
            eliminating or reducing the current COVID-19 outbreak.
          </p>

          <h2 id="entering-info">Entering information on behalf of someone</h2>

            You must be authorized to enter someone else’s information into the tool or when giving information to the
            ministry and/or the public health unit who contacts you for a follow-up. For example, you are the parent or
            guardian of a child who is under the age of 16 years and can consent on behalf of the child.
          </p>
          <p>
            You must be authorized under the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004 to provide this consent on
            behalf of someone else.

          <p>
            You agree that even if the ministry does not insist on or enforce an item in this agreement, they still have
            the right to insist on and enforce that item.

            safeguards to protect its networks and websites from misuse, alteration, copying, disclosure, destruction,
